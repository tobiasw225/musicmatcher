# Image Select Mockup

Run with jquery, css and php
So far I only tested crop-select-js, which is the newest and - in my opinion- the easiest to handle.
**There are still some problems, the output-pic seems to be out of place**

If you want to try it yourself ask me. **We also need to set up a github-repo**.
To run it you'll need
apache2, php-7.x and php7.2-gd

	$ 	sudo apt-get install php7.2-gd

Make sure you have writing permissions
	$	chown -R yourusername:www-data /folder/used/by/EE

(So far) It only works with png or jpeg, but that not a huge problem, since svg can be converted easily to png.

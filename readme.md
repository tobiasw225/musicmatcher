## Who we are and what we do:
@todo who we are

For many years, music has been transferred from generation to generation by two traditions: aural sharing and in the form of written documents, typically known as a musical scores. Many of these scores are available in the form of unpublished handwriting. To correct and edit these sheets of music, some form of typesetting or even an instrument that can automatically match the symbols images and create new scores can be used. As there are already existing projects in which documents are digitized and corrected, e.g. trove, sheet music represents yet another form to be put into digital format. Stains, different styles and other artifacts make a suitable *OCR* difficult to achieve. Interested citizen scientists should correct these mistakes. The result could be make public and the page or optionally used for further projects and education.

The **Musikalisches Wochenblatt** - Organ für Musiker und Musikfreunde (short: MWb), was a music journal in the time of the german empire. It was founded in 1870 by Oscal Paul and published until 1910 in Leipzig. Henceforward it was published by  Ernst Wilhelm Fritsch as the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik (short: NZFM). It discusses developments in music, concerts and features critics from all over Germany with a focus led on Leipzig. In this project we chose to use these documents as our research corpus because of the regional connection to our univerisity and it's rich information about the 19th  as well as the beginning of the 20th century.
